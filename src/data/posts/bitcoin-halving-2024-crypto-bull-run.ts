# Bitcoin Halving 2024: The Catalyst for Crypto's Biggest Bull Run

April 2024 marked a historic moment in cryptocurrency history—Bitcoin's **4th halving event**. Combined with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, we're witnessing what many analysts call the "perfect storm" for crypto.

## What is Bitcoin Halving?

Every 210,000 blocks (roughly 4 years), Bitcoin's mining reward is cut in half:

| Halving | Year | Block Reward | BTC Price (at halving) |
|---------|------|--------------|------------------------|
| 1st | 2012 | 50 → 25 BTC | $12 |
| 2nd | 2016 | 25 → 12.5 BTC | $650 |
| 3rd | 2020 | 12.5 → 6.25 BTC | $8,500 |
| **4th** | **2024** | **6.25 → 3.125 BTC** | **$64,000** |

This programmed scarcity is Bitcoin's most powerful feature—**only 21 million BTC will ever exist**.

## The 2024 Bull Run: What's Different This Time?

### 1. 🏛️ Spot Bitcoin ETFs Approved

In January 2024, the SEC approved **11 spot Bitcoin ETFs**, changing everything:

- **BlackRock's IBIT**: $20+ billion in assets
- **Fidelity's FBTC**: $12+ billion in assets
- **Combined Inflows**: $50+ billion in first year

> "Bitcoin ETFs have brought Wall Street money into crypto. This is institutional adoption at scale." — Cathie Wood, ARK Invest

### 2. 📉 Supply Shock

Post-halving economics:
- **Daily new BTC**: Reduced from 900 to 450
- **Annual inflation**: Dropped to 0.85%
- **Demand**: ETFs buying 10x daily production

### 3. 🌍 Macro Environment

- Central banks cutting interest rates
- Inflation concerns driving "digital gold" narrative
- Geopolitical tensions boosting safe-haven assets

### Historical Patterns

Looking at previous halving cycles:
