  title: 'SpaceX Starship Successfully Reaches Orbit',
  excerpt: 'Elon Musk\'s mega rocket achieves a historic milestone, paving the way for Mars missions.',
  content: `SpaceX has achieved what many thought impossible just a decade ago. The Starship rocket successfully completed a full orbital flight.

## The Journey

Launching from Starbase in Texas, the world's largest rocket performed flawlessly, reaching orbital velocity before a controlled re-entry into the Indian Ocean.

## Mission Timeline

- T+0:00 - Liftoff from Starbase
- T+2:45 - Stage separation successful
- T+8:30 - Orbital velocity achieved
- T+45:00 - De-orbit burn initiated
- T+52:00 - Controlled splashdown

## Technical Achievements

The mission validated several critical systems:
- All 33 Raptor engines fired successfully
- Hot-staging separation worked perfectly
- Heat shield survived re-entry
- New flight computer software performed flawlessly

## What This Means for Mars

This success brings humanity one step closer to becoming a multi-planetary species. SpaceX aims to send the first crewed mission to Mars by 2030.

## Artemis Partnership

NASA's Artemis program will use a modified Starship as the lunar lander. This successful test brings Moon missions closer to reality.

## Reusability Progress

SpaceX plans to attempt a full booster catch on the next flight, potentially revolutionizing rocket economics by eliminating landing legs.

## Musk's Vision

"Today we proved that the impossible is possible. Mars is no longer a dream – it's a destination." - Elon Musk at post-flight press conference

## Next Steps

- Flight 3: Booster catch attempt
- Flight 4: Payload deployment test
- Flight 5: Orbital refueling demo
- 2026: First uncrewed Mars mission`,
