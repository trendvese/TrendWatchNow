## Sustainable Luxury

The new titanium frame is made from 100% recycled ocean plastics and aerospace-grade recycled aluminum. But don't let the eco-friendly materials fool you – this phone feels absolutely premium.

## The Camera Revolution

The 200MP main sensor has been completely redesigned with a new "NightVision" mode that captures stunning photos in near-complete darkness. The 10x periscope zoom now reaches 100x Space Zoom with AI stabilization.

## Performance That Lasts

Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip, the S25 Ultra delivers console-quality gaming while sipping battery. The new 6000mAh silicon-carbon battery provides two full days of heavy use.

## Galaxy AI Integration

Samsung's new Galaxy AI features include:
- Real-time translation during calls
- Smart photo editing with generative AI
- Intelligent text summarization
- Circle to Search integration

## S Pen Evolved

The S Pen now features haptic feedback and gesture controls. Write in the air and watch your notes appear on screen in real-time.`,
